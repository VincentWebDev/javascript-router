# Vanilla JavaScript Router Single Page Application

A simple app to demonstrate the vanilla JavaScript router using a SPA.

I had to take my time learning this with tutorials from other developers. The app uses both JavaScript URL and hash routers.

You can view the app [here](https://javascript-router-tutorial.netlify.app/)
