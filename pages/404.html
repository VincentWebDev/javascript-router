<h2>404 Not Found</h2>
<p>The requested page or route doesn't exist.</p>

<p>
  If you're rendering this JavaScript router code locally or with VSCode live
  server, and you refresh the brower on a URL route that is not the index page,
  you will receive a 404 error (Cannot GET).
</p>

<p>
  I'm hosting the app on Netlify's free account. I created a
  <strong><code>netlify.toml</code></strong> file to handle 404 errors.
</p>

Below is the Netlify code to redirect all 404 url router errors to
<strong><code>index.html</code></strong>. This code overwrites Netlify's own 404 reponse. Normally, you would need to write similar code in a <strong><code>.htaccess</code></strong> file.

<div id="code">
  <p>
  <code
    >[[redirects]]<br />from = "/*"<br />to = "/index.html"<br />status =
    404</code
  >
</div>
